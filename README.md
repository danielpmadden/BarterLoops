# BarterLoops

**AI-assisted barter marketplace prototype. Built twice.**

## Overview

BarterLoops is an experimental project exploring how AI can power a free global barter marketplace.

The idea: instead of simple one-to-one trades, the system discovers multi-party loops (e.g. eggs â†’ hat â†’ rocking chair â†’ eggs) so everyone gets what they want.

This repo contains two MVP scaffolds, both built in about 3.5 hours each using custom GPT coding assistants:

- **Python stack**: FastAPI + Postgres + Nginx
- **C++ stack**: C++17 JSON API + Tailwind frontend + Nginx

Both are fully Dockerized and orchestrated with Compose, running identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux with a single command.

## Project Goals

- **Feasibility**: Prove that a barter loop marketplace can be scaffolded rapidly with AI help
- **Portability**: Containerized services that spin up anywhere
- **Credibility**: Even minimal frontends connect correctly with working backends
- **Exploration**: Compare Python (velocity) vs. C++ (performance) approaches

## Current State

âœ… **Complete**
- Backend services containerized and exposed via Nginx
- Frontends boot and connect to backends (placeholder UIs)
- Cross-platform Docker Compose orchestration

ðŸš§ **Todo**
- User accounts & authentication
- Offer creation & inventory management
- Barter loop matcher service
- Persistence for C++ service
- Image uploads for listings
- Trade loop visualization UI

## Architecture

**Python track**: Browser â†’ Nginx â†’ FastAPI â†’ Postgres  
**C++ track**: Browser â†’ Nginx â†’ C++ JSON API (stateless for now)

Both stacks are managed with `docker compose` for simple, consistent launches.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git

### Run (Python stack)
```bash
cd python/
docker compose up --build
```

### Run (C++ stack)
```bash
cd cpp/
docker compose up --build
```

### Access
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- **Backend health endpoint**: http://localhost:8000/health

## Future Directions

- Graph-based barter matcher (cycle detection, fairness weighting)
- Accounts, authentication, and reputation systems
- Persistent storage, media uploads, and trade history
- Graph visualization for trade loops
- Cloud deployment and observability

## Meta

This project is not a polished product â€” it is a proof of velocity. Two credible MVP foundations stood up in hours show how AI-assisted development can turn ideas into running systems fast.
